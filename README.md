### Docker

To run this app with docker build the image and simply run it a container. The exposed port is `8888`. You should also mount a volume on `/app/data` to preserve the user and the choosen playlist. The healthcheck checks whether the app is running and the user is logged in, if either is false the container will be unhealthy.
